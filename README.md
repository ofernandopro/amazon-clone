# amazon-clone

E-commerce website with a frontend inspired on Amazon.

Feel free to access: https://clone-f28ff.web.app/

The website has a homepage very similar to Amazon's, in which a header is presented with a search bar, the Amazon logo, a box to sign in or sign out, and a box that leads the users to the checkout page. Below the header there is the main banner that presents some ads of Amazon Prime and below that there are the products. The user can add to cart whatever product he wants. Once he adds to the cart, the number of items in the cart that appears in the header changes immediately, beacause it was used React Context API in the project. Take a look in the home page:

Once the user clicks in the Sign-In box in the header, he is redirected to the login page, where he can access his account or, if he doesn't have one, he can create it. The project is connected to Firebase, so his account is saved and he can create one and access it later.

If the user clicks the Basket Icon in the header, he is redirected to the checkout page. In this page, the products inside his basket are shown and a box in his right screen shows how many products does his basket has and the total cost of it. It's all dinamic and the price is changed immediately as he removes or add any product from the basket. It's shown also a box for ads above the products for any ads the website needs to display.
